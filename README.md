# Undergraduate Course Projects
Included in this repository are folders for each course I took with University of Maryland Global Campus. Within each of those folders you will find a collection of projects that I submitted for grading. A READEME will provide a summarization of the project, and a PDF of the project requirements will be found there as well.
